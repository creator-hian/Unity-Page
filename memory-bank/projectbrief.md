# Page Package - Project Brief

## Overview

The Page package is a Unity-based UI system designed for managing page navigation and transitions in the Future Ocean Science Museum project. It provides a structured framework for creating, displaying, and managing interactive pages within exhibits.

## Core Requirements

1. **Page Management System**: Provide a reliable system for creating, showing, and navigating between pages.
2. **Flexible Architecture**: Support various page types through interface-based design.
3. **Transition Effects**: Enable smooth animations for page transitions.
4. **Debug Tools**: Include comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities.
5. **Unity UI Integration**: Seamlessly work with Unity's UI system.

## Target Scenarios

- Information display pages for exhibit explanations
- Interactive exhibit interfaces
- Navigation between different content sections
- Content pages with dynamic data display
- Educational sequence pages

## Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with Unity UI system
- Must support asynchronous operations
- Must provide clear error logging and debugging capabilities
- Must handle page transitions smoothly

## Integration Requirements

This package is designed to work alongside other Future Ocean packages (Tab, Popup) with minimal integration effort through interface-based implementation.
