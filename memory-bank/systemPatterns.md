# Page Package - System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

The Page package follows a modular, interface-based architecture that separates concerns and allows for flexible implementation. The system is designed around core interfaces for pages, controllers, transitions, and event systems.

## Core Design Patterns

### 1. Interface-Based Design

The entire system is built around interfaces rather than concrete implementations, providing:

- **Loose coupling** between components
- **Flexibility** for developers to create custom implementations
- **Testability** through interface mocking
- **Extensibility** without modifying core code

### 2. Service Locator Pattern

- Page controllers and services are accessible through a central registry
- Allows components to request page-related services without tight coupling
- Facilitates runtime swapping of implementations

### 3. State Machine Pattern

- Page navigation follows a state machine model
- Each page represents a state in the application
- Transitions between pages are managed as state transitions
- Ensures consistent state management during navigation

### 4. Observer Pattern

- Page state changes are communicated through events
- Components can subscribe to page lifecycle events (shown, hidden, transitioned)
- Enables separation between page logic and visual representation

## Component Relationships

```
IPageController (Coordinator)
    ↓ manages ↓
IPage (View)
    ↓ uses ↓
IPageTransition (Animation)
    ↓ communicates via ↓
IPageEvent (Events)
```

### IPage

- **Role**: Represents the visual component of a page
- **Responsibility**: Handles display, animations, and user interface elements
- **Pattern**: View component in MVP-like structure

### IPageController

- **Role**: Coordinates page lifecycle and manages global page state
- **Responsibility**: Showing, hiding, and transitioning between pages
- **Pattern**: Coordinator/Manager

### IPageTransition

- **Role**: Handles animation and visual effects between page transitions
- **Responsibility**: Providing smooth, visually appealing transitions
- **Pattern**: Strategy pattern for different transition types

### IPageEvent

- **Role**: Defines event interfaces for page interactions
- **Responsibility**: Standardizing communication between page components
- **Pattern**: Observer pattern implementation

## Cross-cutting Concerns

### Logging

- Centralized `PageLogger` class
- Conditional compilation for development vs. production builds
- Integration with project-wide logging through `LoggingUtils`

### Animation Control

- Standardized animation interfaces
- Cancellation token management for interrupting animations
- Clear animation timing control

## Extension Points

The architecture provides several extension points:

1. **Custom Page Implementations** - Create specialized page types with unique behaviors
2. **Custom Transitions** - Implement unique transition animations between pages
3. **Custom Controllers** - Create specialized page controllers for different exhibit needs
4. **Plugin System** - Hook into page lifecycle events for custom functionality
