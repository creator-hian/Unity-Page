# Page Package - Active Context

## Current Development Status

The Page package is currently in a stable release state (v1.0.0) and is actively being used in the Future Ocean Science Museum project. The core functionality is complete and has been tested in multiple exhibit contexts. The package currently has a dependency on Logging package v1.0.0, which needs to be updated to v1.0.1 for compatibility with other packages.

## Recent Changes

- Initial release of core Page functionality
- Implementation of interface-based page management system
- Integration with Air Quality Monitoring exhibit
- Memory Bank documentation system implementation in progress

## Current Focus Areas

1. **Dependency Updates**

   - Update Logging package dependency from v1.0.0 to v1.0.1
   - Ensure compatibility with latest logging features
   - Test integration with updated dependencies

2. **Developer Experience Improvements**

   - Enhance Editor UI for debug logging management with visual EditorWindow interface
   - Replace menu-based debug symbol management with GUI-based configuration tools
   - Improve discoverability of features through proper Unity menu integration

3. **Integration with Air Quality Monitoring Exhibit**
   - Finalize page integration for exhibit-specific needs
   - Optimize page transitions for information content
   - Ensure proper connection with other UI systems (Tab, Popup)

## Known Issues

- Current menu-based debug symbol management lacks visual feedback
- Documentation for advanced usage scenarios is incomplete
- Page transition animations may occasionally stutter on low-end devices

## Current Integration Points

The Page package is currently being utilized in multiple exhibits, with particular focus on the Air Quality Monitoring section. Key integration points include:

1. **Page Controllers** - Central component for managing page navigation
2. **Page Transitions** - Animation system for page changes
3. **Integration with Tab system** - Coordinated navigation between pages and tabs

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **EditorWindow Development** - Evaluating the best approach for creating an intuitive debug configuration GUI
2. **Dependency Updates** - Planning version update to incorporate Logging package v1.0.1
3. **Documentation Strategy** - Establishing Memory Bank as the primary documentation system

## Learned Patterns

1. Interface-based design significantly improves flexibility across different exhibit requirements
2. Centralizing logging through a dedicated utility class improves consistency and debugging capabilities
3. Clear separation between page management logic and visualization improves maintainability
4. Proper debug tools significantly enhance development productivity
