# Page Package - Product Context

## Purpose and Problem Statement

The Page package was developed to address the need for a consistent, reliable page navigation system throughout the Future Ocean Science Museum's interactive exhibits. Before this package, each exhibit required custom page implementations, leading to:

1. Inconsistent user experiences across exhibits
2. Redundant development effort
3. Difficulty in maintaining and updating page behaviors
4. Complex debugging when page transitions failed

## User Experience Goals

- **Intuitive Navigation**: Provide museum visitors with clear, easy-to-navigate pages and interfaces.
- **Seamless Transitions**: Ensure smooth, animated transitions between pages to maintain a polished, professional experience.
- **Visual Consistency**: Support consistent styling across different page types while allowing for exhibit-specific customization.
- **Responsive Feedback**: Ensure page interactions provide immediate visual feedback, even when content loading might take time.

## Target Users

1. **End Users (Museum Visitors)**

   - Museum visitors of all ages and technical backgrounds
   - Users interacting with touch screens or physical buttons
   - Users who may switch between exhibits and need consistent interaction patterns

2. **Development Team**
   - Unity developers implementing exhibit interfaces
   - UX/UI designers defining the page layouts and aesthetics
   - QA testers verifying navigation behaviors

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases

1. **Information Display**

   - Showing detailed information about marine life or exhibits
   - Displaying explanatory content in structured pages
   - Presenting multimedia content in organized sequences

2. **Interactive Exhibits**

   - Multi-step interactive experiences
   - Educational games or activities
   - User-driven content exploration

3. **Navigation**
   - Primary navigation between exhibit sections
   - Context-aware page sequences
   - Hierarchical content organization

## Integration with Museum Experience

The Page package serves as a foundational UI element that ties together the overall museum experience by providing a consistent navigation pattern across exhibits. It enhances learnability by ensuring visitors only need to understand one page interaction model to navigate all content.
